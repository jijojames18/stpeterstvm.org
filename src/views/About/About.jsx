              The capital city of Thiruvananthapuram had only one church in the
              beginning of the 19th Century, which was the St: George Church at
              Statue Spencer Junction. When the faction fighting started in the
              Malankara Church, surely the wave swept here also. During 1970s,
              which was the beginning of second split, the attitude of defected
              faction towards the Patriarch of Antioch, the Supreme spiritual
              head of the Church was hostile. Those members who wanted to
              maintain the centuries-old connection with the Holy See of Antioch
              withdrew peacefully from the St: George Church without hampering
              the church function. No claim was ever made by these members on
              the church. These members formed an adhoc committee and
              congregation namely Malankara Jacobite Syrian Christian
              Congregation, Thiruvananthapuram. At the request of this
              Committee, Arch Bishop of Malankara Syrian Catholic Church, Late
              Benedict Mar Gregorius allowed his church namely St: Marys Church
              Palayam for worship and officially a new parish came into being on
              Sept.21, 1975 with late lamented Geevarghese Mor Gregorius
              officiating the Holy Qurbono at the St: Marys Church in the true
              Antiochean tradition. The efforts of the members of the parish
              bore fruit when they were able to purchase a plot of land at
              Punnen Road owned by one of the members of our Church and first
              Holy Qurbono was officiated at the temporary thatched shed by the
              late lamented Kuriakose Mor Koorilose on May30th, 1976.On Sept26,
              1976,Late Lamented His Beatitude Mor Baselios Paulose II
              Catholicose of the East laid the foundation stone for the church
              building. Under the dynamic guidance of the Diocesan Metropolitan
              HG Kuriakose Mor Koorilose and Mor Dionysius Thomas (Now
              Catholicose), the then Bishop of Angamali and with the sustained
              and dedicated efforts of the Church Committee, and the whole
              hearted support of the members of the Parish, the storied building
              was completed in the heart of the city at a prime location near
              the Secretariat. It was a golden event in the annals of history of
              the parish which was fortunate enough to have His Holiness Moron
              Mor Ignatius Zakka I Iwas the Prince Patriarch of Antioch and All
              the East as the chief celebrant for the consecration of the church
              on February13and 14,1982 along with Catholicose the East Mor
              Baselios Paulose II and Bishops from India and abroad.

              The main motto of the youth is charity and it isalso the most
              admired and appreciated activity of the youth . We make it sure to
              make routine charity works by finding the needy and giving them a
              helping hand as insisted by our Lord. This is done by visiting old
              age homes, orphanages etc understanding their needs and helping
              them accordingly. A mammoth amount of the youths budget is set
              apart for our routine charity every year. We are also given
              donations by the members of the church to carry out the charity
              works.
